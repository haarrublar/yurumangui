# Yurumangui
This repo will represent as good as possible the Yurumanguí community through their school-community, library and last but not least important: the people.

The main objective: website (for now).


## Website Design Inspirations

Yurumanguí website must be bilingual, basing this in the bilingual initivatives that the community and Communitarian Leader Mary Lili Caicedo had promoted during the last years. In this worldwide view, web desings that integrate and include the communities culture, traditions and social views with a vanguard design is a MUST. Some of those inspirations are:

1. [Vangogh Museum](https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en)
2. [Louvre Museum](https://www.louvre.fr/en)
3. [Rose Family Restaurants](https://rosefamily.com.ua/)
4. [Luther College](https://www.luther.edu/)
